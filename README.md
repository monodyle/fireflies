## About

> The motion of the earth is anything but slow. It actually [spins on it’s axis at about 1,000 miles per hour (1,600 kph)](https://earthsky.org/earth/why-cant-we-feel-earths-spin/). It also moves around the sun at 67,000 miles per hour. We can’t feel its motion because we (and everything else) are also moving along with it at a constant rate.
